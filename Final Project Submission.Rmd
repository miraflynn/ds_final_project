## Question 
Are there racial inequalities in Covid rates in the US?

Story we want to tell is that this is the case, test and death data by race
We cannot compare due to high testing inconsistancies
this trend can apply in states but we can also see alternative trends
Therefore more consistant race reporting is needed to better understand racial impact
States should examine thier situation individually and develop programs to aleviate inequality
Overall we need to implement better safety/testing programs to reduce inequality
focus on lessening inequality
(confounding variable is economic status)
(both in being essential workers and in ability to get tested/decision to go to hospital)
ANSWER: Despite inconsistancies in the data there are clear major racial inequities due to covid

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

#Case Test and Death Data

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r Case Data by Race, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

```{r Test Data by Race, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

```{r Death Data by Race, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```


#Test Reporting Inconsistencies

```{r Case Data by Race Inconsistencies, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

```{r Test Data by Race Inconsistencies, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

```{r Death Data by Race Inconsistencies, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
