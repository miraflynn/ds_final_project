This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
source("cleaning.R")
```

```{r}
all_ratings %>%
  # mutate(
  #   altitude = ifelse(altitude == 190164, 
  #                     1901,
  #                     ifelse(altitude == 1901.64, 
  #                            1901, 
  #                            ifelse(altitude == "1100.00 mosl", 
  #                                   1100,

  #                                          1100, 
  #                                          altitude)))),
  #   altitude_mean_meters = ifelse(altitude_mean_meters >= 9000, altitude, altitude_mean_meters),
  #   altitude_mean_meters = as.double(altitude_mean_meters)
  #   ) %>%
  # filter(altitude_mean_meters >= 9000) %>%
  glimpse()
```
```{r}
all_ratings %>%
  filter(altitude_mean_meters <= 9000) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(altitude_mean_meters))
```



```{r}
all_ratings %>%
  filter(altitude_mean_meters <= 3000) %>%
  filter(total_cup_points >= 50) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(altitude_mean_meters, total_cup_points))
```



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
