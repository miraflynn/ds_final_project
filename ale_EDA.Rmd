This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(modelr)
source("cleaning.R")
set.seed(42)
```
 
```{r vis-usa}
df_states_racial_comb %>% summary()
df_states_racial_comb %>% 
  ggplot()+
  facet_wrap(race) +
  ggplot()
  

```

```{r}
df_states_racial_comb %>%
  group_by(race) %>% 
  summarise(
    deaths_per_cases = sum(deaths, na.rm = "TRUE")/sum(cases, na.rm = "TRUE"),
    hosp_per_cases = sum(hosp, na.rm = "TRUE")/sum(cases,  na.rm = "TRUE"),
    deaths_per_hosp = sum(deaths,  na.rm = "TRUE")/sum(hosp,  na.rm = "TRUE"), 
    groups = "TRUE") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = race)) +
  geom_col(aes(y = deaths_per_cases))
```





Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
